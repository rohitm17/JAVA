/*Abstract class in java.
    An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
    It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
    It cannot be instantiated.
    It can have constructors and static methods also.
    It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
*/
//A factory method is a method that returns the instance of the class.
abstract class A{

	abstract void sum();
	void fun(){
		System.out.println("I am having fun");
	}
}
class B extends A{
	int a=10,b=30;
	void sum(){
		a=a+b;

}
//Rule1: If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.
//Rule2: If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method,you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.
