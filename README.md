# JAVA
A backup of my codes in java from beginner to advance.

The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent code). Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture. 
Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc).
